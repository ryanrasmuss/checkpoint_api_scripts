# Check Point API Scripts 

by: **Ryan Rasmuss**

using: [requests](https://github.com/requests) by **Kenneth Reitz** amd [Check Point API](https://github.com/checkpointsw)

### Overview

- Requires ``python3``
- ``cp_api.py`` is the main script
- ``mgmt_api.sh`` is just a wrapper
- remember that any changes need to be published via ``./mgmt_api.sh publish``
- Remember to enable API on the Management Server via Smart Console
- Run ``api restart`` on Gaia

### Notes

- Can make calls in two way: ``python3 cp_api.py`` or ``./mgmt_api.sh``
- Need to call setup before making api calls: ``./mgmt_api.sh setup [ip_address] [port#/default] [hostname] [pw]``
- Example calls are in ``examples/examples_calls.txt``

### ToDo

- [ ] Delete session.txt when logout or login
- [ ] Need to parse arguments better, need to be able to navigate commands like VBoxManage
- [x] Publish
- [x] Start adding other commands
- [x] Add new gateway w/ sic
- [x] After posts, send message to remind to publish changes!
- [x] Throw in a main()
